\chapter{Introduction}
Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with countable, distinct, and separate objects or structures. It focuses on the study of mathematical structures and concepts that are not continuous, such as integers, graphs, sets, and logical statements. Discrete mathematics plays a crucial role in various fields, including computer science, cryptography, combinatorics, and information theory. It provides tools and techniques for solving problems related to discrete elements and is essential for developing algorithms, analysing data structures, and addressing real-world problems in a wide range of applications.
