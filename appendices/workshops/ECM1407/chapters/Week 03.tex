\subsection{New legislation}
The UK's Online Safety Bill intends to `make the UK the safest place to be online'. The bill will give Ofcom the power, where necessary and proportionate, to require that a company use accredited technology, or make best efforts to develop technology, to tackle child sexual abuse on any part of its service including public and private channels.

This is controversial, as it would make end to end encryption impossible because platforms would need to scan messages for illegal material. The technology (`accredited technology') to do this does also not yet exist. WhatsApp said that they would rather be blocked in the UK than weaken their security.
