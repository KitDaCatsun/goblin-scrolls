\section{Linear Regression}
Linear regression assumes one variable of a model is proportional to another:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linear_regression}
    y = ax + b
\end{equation}
Non-linear regression, for instance quadratic, looks like:
\begin{equation*}
    y = ax^2 + bx + c
\end{equation*}
Or sigmoid:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sigmoid_regression}
    y = \frac{1}{1 + e ^{b-x}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fitting a regression model}
The values of \(a\) and \(b\) could be naively found by randomly sampling or using a grid search. A better method would iteratively search for the best values of \(a\) and \(b\). A generic parameter fitting method is:
\begin{lstlisting}
1. Start at a random point $\(\mathbf{P1}\)$ in parameter space.
2. Calculate the error at $\(\mathbf{P1}\)$.
3. Move to a nearby point $\(\mathbf{P2}\)$.
4. Calculate the error at $\(\mathbf{P2}\)$.
5. Stop when some condition is met.
\end{lstlisting}
A deterministic algorithm would calculate the position \(\mathbf{P2}\) to move to based on \(\mathbf{P1}\) and the calculated error. A stochastic algorithm picks a random point \(\mathbf{P2}\). A deterministic algorithm that uses some randomness will avoid getting `stuck' in local minima.

The conditions that need to be met for the algorithm to stop might include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The error going less than a certain threshold.
    \item Some number of steps having been taken.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Error functions}
Error can be calculated in two ways. L1 norm is:
\begin{equation*}
    \epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^{m}|y_i^{predicted} - y_i^{data}|
\end{equation*}
L2 norm replaces the modulus with a square, and is more common:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y_i^{predicted} - y_i^{data})^2}
    \label{eq:l2_norm}
\end{equation}
The error function can also be called a cost or loss function. Note how \cref{eq:l2_norm} is also the formula for Euclidean distance.

\subsection{Deterministic fitting}
The deterministic algorithm needs to remember some information about the parameter space so that \(\mathbf{P2}\) can be determined. The best movement is to the minimum of the loss function, where the derivative of loss with respect to the parameters is 0:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\delta loss}{\delta a} & = 0 \\
    \frac{\delta loss}{\delta b} & = 0
\end{align*}
Or:
\begin{equation*}
    \vec{\Delta} loss = 0
\end{equation*}
By finding the derivative of the loss function, the deterministic algorithm can move in the direction where the loss function has the steepest gradient.

\begin{lstlisting}
1. Start at a random point $\(\mathbf{P1}\)$ in parameter space.
2. Calculate the error at $\(\mathbf{P1}\)$.
3. Move in the direction of steepest gradient to point $\(\mathbf{P2}\)$.
4. Calculate the error at $\(\mathbf{P2}\)$.
5. Stop when the error has become less than a threshold, or more than $\(N\)$ steps have been taken.
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Fit}
\subsection{Types of fit}
A model is overfitted if it matches training data `too well', so that new data does not fit the old model. If the model is underfitted it does not model the data closely enough to accurately categorise it. A good model is generalised so that it can accommodate data that have not been seen before.

\subsection{Train-test split}
Overfitting can be avoided by training and testing the model on different datasets. The proportion of data in the training set to testing set is normally around 80\%:20\%.

It may be useful to non-randomly sample the dataset, like enforcing ratios of some classes in the sets so that they match the population.

\subsection{Testing fit}
To compare linear regressions on the same variables, the L2 norm can simply be compared. In order to compare linear regressions on different variables, the \(R^2\) metric\footnote{Also called coefficient of determination.} is used. The Sum of Squared Estimates is first calculated:
\begin{equation*}
    SSE^{zero} = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(\overline{y} - y_i^{data})^2
\end{equation*}
This gives a value for the accuracy of a model that always predicts the average. The \(SSE\) of the actual model can then be calculated:
\begin{equation*}
    SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(y_i^{pred} - y_i^{data})^2
\end{equation*}
And finally \(R^2\):
\begin{equation}
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SSE^{zero}}
    \label{eq:r_squared}
\end{equation}
The meanings of \(R^2\) values are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(R^2 \approx 0\): The linear model is just as good as the constant model, there may be no relationship between the variables.
    \item \(R^2 \approx 1\): The linear model is almost as good as the original data.
\end{itemize}
\(R^2\) says how much of the variation in the \(y\) variable is explained by the linear regression.

\subsection{Linear regressions with \emph{N} variables}
With \(N\) variables:
\begin{align*}
    y & = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)  \\
    y & = \sum_{i=1}^{N}a_ix_i + b
\end{align*}
