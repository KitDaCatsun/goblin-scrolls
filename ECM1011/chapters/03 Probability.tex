\section{Probability distributions}
\subsection{Probabilities}
For a distribution with probability density function \(\mathrm{f}(x)\):
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{P}(a < x < b) = \int_a^b \mathrm{f}(x)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Binning}
Binning a distribution refers to the process of taking a continuous distribution and turning it into a discrete distribution by creating discrete bin of values within ranges.

The bin sizes need to be chosen carefully so that key trends in the data are represented without showing meaningless noise in the data.

\subsection{Expected Value}
For a discrete distribution:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{E}(X) = \mu_X = \sum x P(X = x)
\end{equation*}
For a continuous distribution:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{E}(X) = \mu_X = \int x P(X = x) dx
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Variance and Standard Deviation}
For a discrete distribution:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Var}(X) = \sigma_X^2 = \mathrm{E}(X^2) - \mathrm{E}(X)^2
\end{equation}
For a continuous distribution:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Var}(X) = \sigma_X^2 = \mathrm{E}(X^2) - \mathrm{E}(X)^2
\end{equation}
Standard deviation is the square root of variance.

\subsection{Real data}
Real probability distributions can be described as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric, or have skew to the left or right
    \item Uniform
    \item Unimodal, Bimodal, or Multimodal
\end{itemize}

\section{Common Distributions}
\subsection{Bell Distributions}
Bell shaped distributions include the binomial and normal. Most of the data is in the center. The shape is unimodal and symmetric with little skew.

\subsection{One-sided Distributions}
Ome-sided distributions have skew to one side, often because they are only valid for \(x > 0\). The Chi-squared, log normal, and Poisson are one-sided.

\subsection{Bernoulli Distributions}
A bernoulli distribution has two outcomes with probabilities \(p\) and \(1 - p\).

\section{Poisson Distributions}
\subsection{The Poisson distribution}
The Poisson distribution is notated as:
\begin{align*}
    X                 & \sim \mathrm{Po}(\lambda)          \\
    \mathrm{P}(X = x) & = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}
\end{align*}
Where \(\lambda\) is the mean rate.

\subsection{Modelling with the Poisson distribution}
The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of times \(X\) that a particular event occurs within a given interval. This could be an interval of any type, e.g. time or space.

In order for the Poisson distribution to be a good model, events must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be independent.
    \item Occur singly within their interval.
    \item Occur at a constant average rate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adding Poisson distributions}
If \(X \sim \mathrm{Po}(\lambda)\) and \(Y \sim \mathrm{Po}(\mu)\):
\begin{equation*}
    X + Y \sim \mathrm{Po}(\lambda + \mu)
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Mean and Variance of a Poisson distribution}
If \(X \sim \mathrm{Po}(\lambda)\):
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{E}(X)   & = \lambda \\
    \mathrm{Var}(X) & = \lambda
\end{align*}
The equivalence of the expected value and variance can be used to check that the Poisson is a suitable model.

\section{Exponential Distributions}
\subsection{The Exponential Distribution}
The exponential distribution has the density function:
\begin{equation*}
    P(X = x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \{x \geq 0\}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Mean and Variance of an Exponential distribution}
If \(X\) follows an exponential distribution:
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{E}(X)   & = \frac{1}{\lambda}     \\
    \mathrm{Var}(X) & = \frac{1}{\lambda ^ 2}
\end{align*}

\section{Bayesian networks}
\subsection{Bayesian statistics}
For an event \(E\) that is dependent only on events \(A\) and \(B\), the probability \(\mathrm{P}(E)\) can be found with:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{P}(E) = \mathrm{P}(E | A) \times P(A) + \mathrm{P}(E | B) \times \mathrm{P}(B)
    \label{eq:dependent_probabilities}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bayesian networks}
A chain of dependent events can be shown as a graph. The probability of any event in the graph depends only on its parents. The graph must be a directed acyclic graph (DAC).

This network is called a Bayesian network.

\subsection{Bayes' Theorem}
Rearranging \cref{eq:dependent_probabilities} gives Bayes' theorem:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathrm{P}(B|A) \times \mathrm{P}(A)}{\mathrm{P}(B)}
    \label{eq:bayes_theorem}
\end{equation}
\begin{example}
    For a test for a disease, the equation would look like:
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathrm{P}(infected|\textit{tested positive}) = \frac{\mathrm{P}(\textit{tested positive}|infected) \times \mathrm{P}(infected)}{\mathrm{P}(\textit{tested positive})}
    \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Application of Bayes' Theorem}
The sensitivity of a test is the probability of a true positive result (\(\mathrm{P}(T_+|B)\)). The specificity is the probability of a true negative result (\(\mathrm{P}(T_- | \neg B)\)).

If \(\mathrm{P}(B)\) is small, then \(\mathrm{P}(B|A)\) will also be small.
