\section{Glossary}
An algorithm is a step by step procedure specified to a level of detail such that any person or machine can follow.

Machine learning algorithms use mathematics and statistics to find patterns about data. When these patterns look sufficiently complicated, people call it artificial intelligence. Learning is when changes in a system take place that enable the system to complete a task (or a task from a population of similar tasks) more effectively the next time.

Data can be quantitative, or qualitative. Quantitative data uses numbers, whereas qualitative data describes using words like `smooth' or `good'. Categorical data separates the data into categories. Ordinal data assigns values from a range like `poor', `good', `very good'.

Most data will be a mix of different types.
